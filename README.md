# tinfoil: TLS Is Not For Obligatory Interception Lovers

This repository is a place to collect together arguments
for not breaking TLS.

At some point it may be worth turning this into an
Internet-draft to save us all time for when the next
crappy break-TLS proposal comes along.

PRs that add to (really, record) those arguments are
welcome, especially if they identify problems with specific 
proposals to break TLS.

## Meta-Points

In this section we call out some generic issues that all
cause all "break-TLS" proposals to fail.

- As with most of these break-TLS attempts, the proponents
have apparently only analysed the deployments about which
they care, and ignore all other uses of TLS. There are
many other uses of TLS, for example the TLS1.2 RFC is
currently (20170711) [referenced by](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc5246/referencedby/) 434 other IETF specifications, and 
is [cited](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hjp.at%2Fdoc%2Frfc%2Frfc5246.html&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5) by 3,281 publications
in Google Scholar. Screwing around with such a protocol without
due dilligence is utterly unwise.

- Note that I make no allegations about the bona-fides
of any of the proponents of the "break-TLS" schemes.
I know and respect some of them, but they are misguided.
However, we cannot ignore the fact that some governments
are very keen to weaken Internet security and privacy 
and have allocated significant budgets for that.
[BULLRUN](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-gchq-encryption-codes-security)
for example is reported to involved wasting/spending US$250M/yr
on this. It is inevitable that some of that money ends up
being spent/wasted on schemes to break or weaken TLS.
The consequence of that is that it is entirely proper
to consider the pervasive monitoring aspects of any 
"break-TLS" proposal, no matter what motivations are
set out by proponents. (And again, that says nothing
at all about proponents motivations, it's just a thing
that we have to consider regardless.)

## Specific "break-TLS" proposals

### [draft-green-tls-static-dh-in-tls13-01](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-green-tls-static-dh-in-tls13-01)

This is one of the current proposals for breaking TLS.
It fails in the following ways:

- The [TLS working group charter](https://tools.ietf.org/wg/tls/charters)
dated 2017-03-30 calls for improving the security of TLS, and 
this proposal involves leaking private key material and hence
falls outside the charter.

- This draft is targeted as being an IETF standards track document
but is a wiretapping scheme that meets the definition in
[RFC2804](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2804) and therefore
cannot be a standards-track work item in the IETF.

- Some have argued that even if this cannot be an
IETF standards track specification, it should still be
developed in the IETF. That also goes against RFC2804,
which calls for documentation and not development,
of deployed wiretapping schemes. Documenting the
wiretapping schemes that exist is a good thing. 
Developing new ones is a bad thing, for all the
reasons set out explicitly in RFC2804. As a 
speculative new wiretapping design, this draft
should not be an IETF specification of any kind, 
so long as RFC2804 has not been obsoleted, and
yet the authors here are making no attempt to
obsolete 2804, and are thus attempting an end-run
around IETF processes.

- This draft aims to provide wiretapping only "within"
enterprise networks, but there is no way (and cannot be a way)
to constrain the use of this scheme to such networks.
Figure 3 of the draft clearly describes a generic 
wiretapping architecture for TLS that could (and would)
be used in many other circumstances that the authors
have apparently not envisaged.

- This draft tries to standardise broken crypto - forward
secrecy is a goal of cryptographic protocols and this 
draft deliberately aims to not provide forward secrecy
and indeed to break forward secrecy without the TLS
client being aware of that.

- The argument has been made that it would be better
to scrutinise proposals such as this openly in the IETF
instead of having individual vendors develop their
own bad-crypto implementations. As a counter to that,
while scrutiny is good for good crypto, the overall
ecosystem will be harmed by wide-spread use of the
same bad-crypto, so therefore in the case of
bad-crypto proposals such as this, it is better for
us all that there is not a single standard.

- For the enterprise uses claimed to justify this,
there is no need for Internet-scale interoperability
as the enterprise network is by-definition under
a single entity's control. (And if they cannot
control their network, then adding broken crypto
seems even more unwise.)

- This draft doesn't allow TLS clients and applications
above or behind the TLS server to know that wiretapping
is occurring.

- Ossification: this draft would introduce new ways of
ossifying TLS, for example, the so-called "TLS decrypter" would
have to be able to handle all updated ciphersuites before
those could be used by bona-fide TLS clients and servers.
We have seen that non-updated PKCS#1.5 crypto hardware
has caused problems with updating the crypto in TLS
for decades now, and this would cause similar problems.

- This proposal entirely suits what governments doing
pervasive monitoring would need in an API. The IETF
has documented its consensus that [Pervasive Monitoring is an Attack](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7258)
in RFC 7258, and this API would assist with such 
attacks. In case this seems somewhat abstract, we
have evidence of exactly this kind of key exfiltration
API in IPsec, as documented by [Wouters](https://nohats.ca/wordpress/blog/2014/12/29/dont-stop-using-ipsec-just-yet/)
and [Der Spiegel](http://www.spiegel.de/media/media-35515.pdf).

- We also have a documented case where a law enforcement agency 
have attempted to coerce a mail service provider 
([Lavabit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavabit) to
providing TLS secret key materials. Developing an API
such as envisaged in this draft would encourage such
law enforcement attempts at key recovery in many countries.

#### Why is this wiretapping?

Some of the authors have denied that this is a wiretapping
propospal, based on not matching the definitions in RFC2804.
However, with SMTP/TLS and with any intermediate MTA, this
clearly allows that intermediate MTA to renege and leak
their private values and hence senders and recipients will
not get the confidentiality they expect. Note that SMTP/TLS
is almost ubiquituous today and that 2-TLS session setups
are common, e.g. if the intermediary MTA does AV scanning.

For example, about mcTLS, if you have the energy to
consider that nonsense.
